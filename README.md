# kNN_Classifier
kNN classifier

The project represents the C++ implementation of the kNN algorithm of the classification.

Basic functionality to be implemented:
  1. Efficient storage structures - Quad tree or kD (probably 2D trees in the case of this classifier)
  2. User interface, prediction and visualization of values by using the kNN classifier
