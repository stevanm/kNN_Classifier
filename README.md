# kNN_Classifier
kNN classifier

The project represents the C++ implementation of the kNN classification algorithm.

Basic functionality to be implemented:

  1. Some of efficient spatial data structures: 
    - Quad-tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree);
    - kD-tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree);
    
  2. User interface for prediction and visualization of results obtained by kNN classifier;
