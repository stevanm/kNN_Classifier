# kNN_Classifier
kNN classifier

The project represents the C++ implementation of the kNN algorithm of the classification.

Basic functionality to be implemented:

  1. Some of efficient storage structures: 
    - Quad-tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) 
    - kD-tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree)
    
  2. User interface, prediction and visualization of values by using the kNN classifier
