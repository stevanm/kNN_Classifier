Machine Learning Smart (mlSmart)

- The project represents the Python implementation of the game for two players. 

- The player plays the game against Machine-Learning-Software player (further a MLS player).

- The first part of the game is to teach the MLS player some rules and possibilities of playing. MLS player watches the current player and tries to learn what he is doing and how he plays (movement, moves, and more).
